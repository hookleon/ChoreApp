## **Chore Roulette**

Chore Roulette is an app that allows households to manage and assign chores to its members. It randomly assigns chores to members and creates a simple roster for households to follow each week to keep your house tidy and clean while also being fair that one person doesn't have to do all the work.

 **Our Alpha release has these features:**
* Creation of new household: add members and chores (only small list available for now)
* Lists the members with assigned chores
* Login using a unique house ID
* Edit members in your household
* Supports usage on multiple phones with fast update
 
**Our Beta release has these new features:**
* Swap chores
* Timer for each week
* Change chores in settings

**Our current release has these features:**
* Simple choose a day and time for chores to change each week
* Nice logo when app starts up
* Small changes to make our app feel and look better
